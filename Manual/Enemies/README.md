# Enemies

It's your rivals, they not working at your side, but against you.

## Appearing

There is always random count of enemies shown on the battle field, varying from 1 to 5.

When battle starts the biggest priority is given to largest foes. Anyway, you can encounter five spiders in a row, but it's pretty rare chance.

They appearing from left to right side, saving space.

## Main kinds

Enemies divided by strategy they used.

### Attacker

Simply attacks the player with physical force each turn.

### Poisonous

Same as attacker, but has a 1 / 8 chance to poison victim instead of attack.

## Boss battles

More serious enemies called bosses. You can't escape in battle against them.

## General tips

- When your [HP](https://github.com/Alexxx180/Desert-Rage/blob/help/Manual/Status/Stats/README.md#hp-health-points) is extremely low it's better to run away or cure as fast as you can
- Analyze foes to build more effective individual strategies
- It's not necessary to always heal poison, sometimes refilling [HP](https://github.com/Alexxx180/Desert-Rage/blob/help/Manual/Status/Stats/README.md#hp-health-points) will work better
