## Who is this Git and why do they make crafts from branches there too?

[X] Alexxx180/Tatarintsev_8901 repository, master branch.

[?] You don't know basics? We come here to fix that.

### Header

( i ) It's same user interface to sign in, search and so on.

### Search line

( i ) There we could type path to someone repo:
  github.com/[repo address]

/!\ So, full path is:
  github.com/[repo address][/tree/[branch]]

### Branches hierarchy

/!\ There could be various branches. By the rules good repo
always should have one main - constantly working master branch.

(@) Let's take usual branchs complex to follow by flow model:

    master_________|________
    \_develop_____/_______/
    __\_features___/_/_/
    __|_bugfixes____/_/

( i ) As a rule, each branch symbolize section of developers
working at something.

## Files

### Repository space

    Main workplace presented as rectangle, rounded at the edges. 

( i ) In the left top corner are repo creator icon and login.  

( i ) To change branches you can use combobox above workspace.
  
  It's pretty simple: files are placed in directories like in
file systems.

/!\ Note that it's not usual files, but changes attached to  
them.

## Version Control System

### Let's think a little

(@) After long work, something x-treme happened. You lost all
you have got.

We can escape this nightmare pretty simple - set up version  
control system on local machine then attach all changes to  
remote origin. GitHub, for example.

(@) Okay, you lost some files. And if you have some recent  
backups, this saves the day.

### The most interesting is ahead
